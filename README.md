# dotfiles
This is the repository containing the dotfiles on my system. People seem to like sharing these, and who knows, maybe you'll find something useful here :shrug:.

## Usage
To use these dotfiles you'll need to have [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) installed.

Some definitions for secrets are also present - you'll need to remove these before using the configs in your own setups.
